# Abstract

Pizza (@pizza2000identification) is an understudied yet widely utilized implement for delivering in-vivo *Solanum lycopersicum* based liquid mediums in a variety of next-genees. Here we describe a de novo approach for large scale *T. aestivum* assemblies based on protein folding that drastically reduces the generation time of the mutation rate.

"what is the state of the art for this section of the NLP pipeline? Tokenizer, Noun recognition, 

https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJText.jl 

Which of these ^items could I performance engineer since it is running a little slower than usual?

Could focus on NaiveBayes

What can I parallelize in the pipeline? The model itself? the preprocessing portion?
