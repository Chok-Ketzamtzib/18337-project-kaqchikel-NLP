# Abstract

Kaqchikel is a language in the Mayan language family, spoken in Guatemala by about 500,000 people. As of this writing, there are no existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) application for this Mayan language, which leads to a lack of tools that could be implemented to help preserve the language in an advancing and globalized world. The text classification will use a Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) parallel model and a parallel Naive Bayes algorithm to perform sentiment analysis on the Kaqchikel Chronicles, a collection or rare pre-colonial texts.
